# GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides guidance on troubleshooting GitHub Actions workflow issues for the Safari extension CI/CD pipeline.

## Common Issues

### Startup Failures

If your GitHub Actions workflow is failing with a "startup_failure" status, it could be due to one of the following issues:

1. **Syntax errors in the workflow file**: Check for YAML syntax errors, indentation issues, or invalid workflow syntax.
2. **Invalid job dependencies**: Ensure that job dependencies are correctly defined and that all referenced jobs exist.
3. **Invalid environment variables**: Check that all environment variables are correctly defined and that they don't contain invalid characters.
4. **Invalid secrets**: Ensure that all required secrets are available in the repository settings.
5. **Invalid runner specification**: Verify that the specified runner is available and correctly configured.

### Execution Failures

If your workflow starts but fails during execution, it could be due to:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed.
2. **Invalid commands**: Check that all commands are valid and correctly formatted.
3. **Timeout issues**: If a job is taking too long, it might be timing out. Consider increasing the timeout or optimizing the job.
4. **Resource constraints**: If the job requires more resources than available, it might fail. Consider using a larger runner or optimizing the job.
5. **Permission issues**: Ensure that the workflow has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Start with a Minimal Workflow

Create a minimal workflow file to verify that GitHub Actions is working correctly:

```yaml
name: Minimal Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, simplified-cicd ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run a simple command
        run: echo "Hello, world!"
```

### 2. Gradually Add Complexity

Once the minimal workflow is working, gradually add complexity to identify the specific cause of the failure:

1. Add one job at a time
2. Add one step at a time
3. Add one environment variable at a time
4. Add one secret at a time

### 3. Check Logs

Check the logs for error messages that might indicate the cause of the failure:

1. Look for error messages in the workflow logs
2. Check for warnings or notices that might indicate potential issues
3. Verify that all commands are executing as expected

### 4. Validate Workflow Syntax

Use the GitHub Actions workflow validator to check for syntax errors:

1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Click on "New workflow"
3. Paste your workflow YAML
4. Check for any syntax errors or warnings

### 5. Test Locally

Consider testing your workflow locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to identify issues before pushing to GitHub:

```bash
# Install act
brew install act

# Run the workflow locally
act -j test
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows simple**: Avoid complex workflows with many dependencies and conditions.
2. **Use standard actions**: Use standard GitHub Actions where possible instead of custom scripts.
3. **Validate inputs**: Validate all inputs and environment variables before using them.
4. **Add proper error handling**: Add proper error handling to catch and report issues.
5. **Use timeouts**: Add timeouts to prevent workflows from running indefinitely.
6. **Add proper logging**: Add detailed logging to help diagnose issues.
7. **Use matrix builds**: Use matrix builds to test multiple configurations in parallel.
8. **Cache dependencies**: Cache dependencies to speed up builds.
