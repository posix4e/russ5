        // Navigate to a URL in Safari
        // This part is tricky as directly controlling Safari's URL bar is complex in UI tests.
        // A common workaround is to use `open(_:)` on XCUIApplication for your own app
        // with a URL scheme that then opens Safari, or to manually navigate if running on a device.
        // For automated tests, we often rely on deep linking if available or a helper app.
        //
        // Simpler approach for now: Assume we can tell Safari to open a URL.
        // This specific `open(URL)` is for the SUT (System Under Test), not arbitrary apps.
        // So, this direct Safari URL opening might not work as expected from XCUIApplication.
        //
        // A more reliable way to open a URL in Safari from a test is often to
        // have your own app open it via UIApplication.shared.open.
        // However, for a pure UI test starting with Safari:
        // We will try to tap the URL bar, type, and go.

        // Tap the URL bar (this often changes based on iOS version and Safari layout)
        // This is a common point of failure and may need adjustment.
        // Let's try finding the "URL" text field or a button that represents it.

        // To ensure data is fresh for the test, ideally, we'd clear HistoryDatabase.
        // Since UI tests run in a separate process, directly calling HistoryDatabase.clear() isn't easy.

        // 1. Add a UI element in the app (DEBUG only) to clear history.
